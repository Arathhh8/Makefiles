# Makefile

The Makefile utility automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.

Once a suitable makefile exists, each time you change source files, this simple shell command:

    make

sufficies to perform all necessary recompilations. The make program uses the makefile data base and the last-modification times of the files to decide which of the files need to be updated. For each of those files, it issues the recipes recorded in the data base.

## GETTING STARTED

You need a file called a makefile to tell make what to do. Most often, the makefiles tells make how to compile and link a program.

When make recompiles the editor, each changed C source file must be recompiled. If a header files has changed, each C source file that includes the header file must be recompiled to be safe. Each compilation produces an object file corresponding to the source file. Finally, if any source file has been recompiled, all the object files, whether newly made or saved from previous compilations, must be linked together to produce the new executable editor.

### What a Rule Looks linke

A simple makefile consists of "rules" with the following shape:

    target ... : prerequisites ...
            recipe
            ...
            ...

A **target** is usually the name of a file that is generated by a program; examples of targets are executable or object files. A target can also be the name of an action to carry out, such as 'clen'.

A **prerequisite** is a file
